// A stack can be used to ensure that an arithmetic expression has balanced parentheses. Write a function that takes an arithmetic expression as an argument and returns true or false based on matching parenthesis. As a bonus provide a meaningful error message to the user as to what's missing. For example, you are missing a ( or missing a ")".

// For version 1, the parentheses you need to consider are ( and ). Finding a close parenthesis without an open parenthesis is an error (report the location of the close); reaching the end of the string while still "holding" an open parenthesis is also an error (report the location of the open).

// Extension exercise: Recognize 3 pairs of brackets: (), [], and {}. These must be correctly nested; "([)]" is incorrect, and should report an error at the ), stating that you were expecting a ] but found a ). If this is starting to look and sound very familiar, congratulations - you're beginning to write a simple language parser!

// Extension extension exercise: Also recognize 2 types of quote character: "" and ''. Inside quotes, brackets aren't counted at all - in fact, nothing is counted until you reach the corresponding close quote.
